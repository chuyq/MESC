# MESC

## The MESC dataset is derived from the TV show *In Treatment*, specifically covering seasons 1 to 3. This series chronicles the weekly sessions of psychotherapist Paul Weston with his patients, as well as his own counseling with a therapist.

## You can directly use the train, validation, and test sets for training your model, which contain the emotion clues extracted from both video and audio. If you prefer to extract emotion clues by yourself, you can refer to the `MESC.csv` file to obtain timestamps and download the raw videos from the website to process the multimodal data.
