He follows me.,Client,depression,undefined,6,6,1,1,"00:10:49,892","00:10:51,030"

So I realized i needed to make a decision.,Client,neutral,undefined,6,14,1,1,"00:11:13,773","00:11:15,818"
By following me to the bathroom this guy was also giving me an ultimatum.,Client,disgust,undefined,6,15,1,1,"00:11:16,989","00:11:20,366"
"I thought, fuck, out of the pan and into the fire.",Client,disgust,undefined,6,16,1,1,"00:11:22,016","00:11:24,624"

and their e.R. Is tops.,Client,depression,undefined,27,9,1,2,"00:15:51,064","00:15:52,680"
Let's go back to this--,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation,27,10,1,2,"00:15:52,820","00:15:54,797"
"Yeah, we're getting there. You have no patience.",Client,anger,undefined,27,11,1,2,"00:15:54,994","00:15:57,848"
I was told you were a good listener.,Client,anger,undefined,27,12,1,2,"00:16:00,679","00:16:02,482"
Now look...,Client,depression,undefined,27,13,1,2,"00:16:04,339","00:16:05,343"
It works on a very simple principle.,Client,depression,undefined,27,14,1,2,"00:16:06,695","00:16:08,366"
It reduces the shock to the body's systems,Client,depression,undefined,27,15,1,2,"00:16:08,885","00:16:10,726"
by dropping the body temperature.,Client,depression,undefined,27,16,1,2,"00:16:10,866","00:16:12,519"
Oh. So how long were you--,Therapist,neutral,Open question,27,17,1,2,"00:16:12,922","00:16:14,490"
"In my case, 48 hours. It's a record.",Client,joy,undefined,27,18,1,2,"00:16:14,706","00:16:17,457"

for such a long period of time.,Client,joy,undefined,27,20,1,2,"00:16:20,048","00:16:21,692"
I guess I went a long way up that tunnel?,Client,joy,undefined,27,21,1,2,"00:16:22,157","00:16:24,458"
The tunnel that wasn't there.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,27,22,1,2,"00:16:25,331","00:16:26,851"
"No, unfortunately not.",Client,depression,undefined,27,23,1,2,"00:16:28,115","00:16:29,758"

A terrible fatigue.,Client,neutral,undefined,27,27,1,2,"00:16:41,044","00:16:42,194"
I guess that's why they call it dead tired.,Client,neutral,undefined,27,28,1,2,"00:16:42,860","00:16:44,741"
It's physical but mainly mental--,Client,neutral,undefined,27,29,1,2,"00:16:45,056","00:16:47,295"
Exhaustion.,Client,neutral,undefined,27,30,1,2,"00:16:48,098","00:16:49,140"

I'm not trying to get at anything.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,7,1,2,"00:17:07,227","00:17:08,758"
But what you're describing is a strong will to live.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,8,1,2,"00:17:08,898","00:17:12,839"

despite having made this effort to live...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,12,1,2,"00:17:18,847","00:17:22,265"
Everybody's disappointed.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,13,1,2,"00:17:23,874","00:17:25,147"
"Listen, it's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead.",Client,neutral,undefined,28,14,1,2,"00:17:25,837","00:17:29,039"
It's a one-in-a-million thing.,Client,neutral,undefined,28,15,1,2,"00:17:29,480","00:17:30,895"
"And if you don't supply the goods, then...",Client,neutral,undefined,28,16,1,2,"00:17:31,292","00:17:33,048"

Never.,Client,neutral,undefined,28,20,1,2,"00:17:41,196","00:17:42,539"
So...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,21,1,2,"00:17:41,196","00:17:42,539"
perhaps your anger isn't directed at the people,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,22,1,2,"00:17:42,751","00:17:44,685"
who were interested in the tunnel.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,23,1,2,"00:17:44,825","00:17:46,403"

that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,28,27,1,2,"00:17:52,309","00:17:54,696"
I have a brother who's not too bright. He's a real estate agent.,Client,neutral,undefined,29,0,1,2,"00:17:56,798","00:17:59,466"

to be a member of an elite? That it wasn't your decision?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,32,11,1,2,"00:21:52,676","00:21:55,418"

and now she wants to have an abortion.,Client,depression,undefined,54,23,1,5,"00:06:43,237","00:06:45,664"

is to get rid of the husband if you ask me.,Client,depression,undefined,54,25,1,5,"00:06:47,780","00:06:49,657"

"So he comes back, he goes on leave",Client,depression,undefined,55,7,1,5,"00:08:40,313","00:08:42,198"
and then he runs for 22 miles without stopping,Client,depression,undefined,55,8,1,5,"00:08:42,318","00:08:45,195"
and brings a heart attack on to himself.,Client,depression,undefined,55,9,1,5,"00:08:45,315","00:08:47,765"

I remember you said once that one of our biggest problems,Client,depression,undefined,56,4,1,5,"00:09:54,751","00:09:56,926"
was that we don't have an audience.,Client,depression,undefined,56,5,1,5,"00:09:57,046","00:09:58,679"
"We don't have anybody to pat us on the back,",Client,depression,undefined,56,6,1,5,"00:09:58,905","00:10:00,923"

At home? Why?,Client,depression,undefined,57,2,1,5,"00:10:42,105","00:10:43,516"

I felt it was inappropriate.,Client,neutral,undefined,57,13,1,5,"00:11:21,232","00:11:23,082"
Then you call me out of the blue.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,57,14,1,5,"00:11:24,432","00:11:26,076"
"Yes, because I needed somebody to talk to.",Client,neutral,undefined,57,15,1,5,"00:11:26,196","00:11:28,899"
You were the one who chose to stop having a supervisor.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,57,16,1,5,"00:11:30,074","00:11:32,940"

"Yes, I said that.",Client,neutral,undefined,57,20,1,5,"00:11:40,859","00:11:42,074"

when a supervisor has to take a stand.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,57,22,1,5,"00:11:44,064","00:11:46,361"

"This isn't me being stubborn, Paul.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,124,26,1,10,"00:20:54,250","00:20:56,274"
I think we should just discuss the possibility,Therapist,neutral,Advisement,124,27,1,10,"00:20:56,434","00:20:59,235"
that Laura's better off with a different therapist.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement,124,28,1,10,"00:20:59,395","00:21:02,074"

It's not like we take a position and we hunt for ways to support it.,Client,anger,undefined,124,38,1,10,"00:21:23,555","00:21:26,717"
That's not what I'm doing. I'm listening.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement,124,39,1,10,"00:21:26,877","00:21:29,610"

"But they're two totally different situations, Gina.",Client,anger,undefined,124,41,1,10,"00:21:33,857","00:21:37,017"
Are you saying that I pushed Kate into this situation?,Client,anger,undefined,125,0,1,10,"00:21:43,188","00:21:45,839"
That I created this environment at home,Client,anger,undefined,125,1,1,10,"00:21:45,999","00:21:48,449"
so that Kate could go fuck an insurance agent,Client,anger,undefined,125,2,1,10,"00:21:49,871","00:21:52,541"
because really I'm in love with Laura?,Client,anger,undefined,125,3,1,10,"00:21:52,792","00:21:55,339"

You made a crack about my father leaving my mother for a patient.,Client,neutral,undefined,125,19,1,10,"00:22:42,811","00:22:46,587"
What was that supposed to mean?,Client,neutral,undefined,125,20,1,10,"00:22:47,186","00:22:49,236"

At the same time.,Client,sadness,undefined,169,18,1,13,"00:14:55,154","00:14:56,486"

I don't know.,Client,sadness,undefined,169,20,1,13,"00:15:03,066","00:15:04,393"

Because I fell off the beam.,Client,depression,undefined,170,6,1,13,"00:15:23,515","00:15:25,335"
I'd been going for this back bend,Client,depression,undefined,170,7,1,13,"00:15:26,541","00:15:28,608"
And for some reason I thought the beam,Client,depression,undefined,170,8,1,13,"00:15:28,609","00:15:30,475"
Was longer than it really was,Client,depression,undefined,170,9,1,13,"00:15:30,476","00:15:32,366"

i bent right off of it.,Client,depression,undefined,170,11,1,13,"00:15:34,779","00:15:36,516"
I fell flat on my back.,Client,depression,undefined,170,12,1,13,"00:15:36,624","00:15:38,432"

That night I slept on the couch.,Client,sadness,undefined,171,0,1,13,"00:16:10,511","00:16:12,648"

"I told you roy was obsessed with chess, right?",Client,joy,undefined,318,12,1,32,"00:12:44,394","00:12:47,445"
I got him this magnificent set.,Client,joy,undefined,319,0,1,32,"00:12:48,474","00:12:50,004"
"It was all ivory, imported from Nairobi,",Client,joy,undefined,319,1,1,32,"00:12:50,174","00:12:52,502"
Just a real work of art.,Client,joy,undefined,319,2,1,32,"00:12:52,672","00:12:54,235"
"And he just looked at the pieces, mesmerized.",Client,joy,undefined,319,3,1,32,"00:12:54,540","00:12:57,225"
"But the board, that was only half of the gift. The other half...",Client,joy,undefined,319,4,1,32,"00:12:57,655","00:13:00,311"
was that I had been working on my own chess game,Client,joy,undefined,319,5,1,32,"00:13:00,481","00:13:02,631"
And I was gonna play my boy.,Client,joy,undefined,319,6,1,32,"00:13:02,801","00:13:05,195"
So we sat down at the chessboard. Everybody's watching.,Client,joy,undefined,319,7,1,32,"00:13:06,042","00:13:08,605"
I thought i'd open with something simple...,Client,joy,undefined,319,8,1,32,"00:13:09,366","00:13:12,171"
"The king's indian, which is where you establish your pawns",Client,joy,undefined,319,9,1,32,"00:13:12,613","00:13:14,885"

"Then he moved, and I countered.",Client,joy,undefined,319,11,1,32,"00:13:16,642","00:13:18,788"
And he moved again. I countered again.,Client,depression,undefined,319,12,1,32,"00:13:18,958","00:13:20,880"
And we're moving along at this real nice clip,Client,joy,undefined,319,13,1,32,"00:13:21,050","00:13:22,909"
and I think I'm holding my own.,Client,joy,undefined,319,14,1,32,"00:13:23,079","00:13:24,900"
And then...,Client,neutral,undefined,319,15,1,32,"00:13:25,736","00:13:26,824"
I'll never forget it. He looked up suddenly,Client,neutral,undefined,319,16,1,32,"00:13:29,416","00:13:31,566"
and it was like a shadow fell over his face.,Client,neutral,undefined,319,17,1,32,"00:13:33,291","00:13:35,300"
"And he stood up from the table and he said,",Client,neutral,undefined,319,18,1,32,"00:13:36,702","00:13:39,181"
I'm not feeling well. I don't want to play.,Client,neutral,undefined,319,19,1,32,"00:13:40,514","00:13:42,974"
He goes up to his bedroom.,Client,neutral,undefined,319,20,1,32,"00:13:45,936","00:13:47,363"
I follow him up the stairs. I knock on the door.,Client,neutral,undefined,319,21,1,32,"00:13:47,533","00:13:49,814"
He doesn't answer. I crack the door open and I see him.,Client,neutral,undefined,319,22,1,32,"00:13:49,984","00:13:52,813"
He's sitting at his desk. He's got his back to me.,Client,neutral,undefined,319,23,1,32,"00:13:52,983","00:13:55,734"

"I was about to say something, but I didn't.",Client,neutral,undefined,319,25,1,32,"00:13:58,596","00:14:00,391"
I just stood there and I stared at the back of his head.,Client,neutral,undefined,319,26,1,32,"00:14:00,561","00:14:03,753"
Something about him... I don't know what it was...,Client,depression,undefined,319,27,1,32,"00:14:05,568","00:14:08,145"
It broke my heart.,Client,depression,undefined,319,28,1,32,"00:14:11,936","00:14:13,150"
"Then I heard these footsteps coming up behind me, I turn around",Client,depression,undefined,319,29,1,32,"00:14:16,711","00:14:19,127"

I shook my head.,Client,depression,undefined,319,31,1,32,"00:14:23,516","00:14:24,840"
"And he gives me that look, that look that sees right through you.",Client,depression,undefined,319,32,1,32,"00:14:25,010","00:14:27,762"
"He says, He knew in three moves, Alex,",Client,depression,undefined,319,33,1,32,"00:14:28,845","00:14:31,483"
You were gonna lose.,Client,depression,undefined,319,34,1,32,"00:14:31,943","00:14:33,343"
He didn't want to beat his father in front of the whole family.,Client,depression,undefined,319,35,1,32,"00:14:33,897","00:14:37,030"
He felt sorry for you.,Client,depression,undefined,319,36,1,32,"00:14:37,510","00:14:38,871"
Do you think he was right?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,319,37,1,32,"00:14:40,492","00:14:41,788"

and you turn soft as butter.,Client,disgust,undefined,320,3,1,32,"00:14:55,238","00:14:57,197"
He didn't understand why I wasn't eager to fly again,Client,disgust,undefined,320,4,1,32,"00:14:57,835","00:15:00,924"
or why I was away from home doing god knows what,Client,disgust,undefined,320,5,1,32,"00:15:01,284","00:15:04,056"

I raised you to be stronger than that. I raised you to be a man.,Client,disgust,undefined,320,8,1,32,"00:15:08,616","00:15:11,328"
And he wanted to know who put all these ideas in my head.,Client,disgust,undefined,320,9,1,32,"00:15:11,498","00:15:14,644"
Who turned me into a... What did he...,Client,disgust,undefined,320,10,1,32,"00:15:15,010","00:15:17,245"
"Who turned me into a selfish, whining little bitch.",Client,disgust,undefined,320,11,1,32,"00:15:17,621","00:15:20,364"
Was it the fags I was hanging around with?,Client,disgust,undefined,320,12,1,32,"00:15:20,534","00:15:22,274"
Or was it... And this one he really seized on... Was it the shrink?,Client,disgust,undefined,320,13,1,32,"00:15:22,444","00:15:25,445"

"I worked all weekend,",Client,neutral,undefined,485,0,2,11,"00:02:36,161","00:02:37,470"
which was fine because this was the weekend,Client,neutral,undefined,485,1,2,11,"00:02:37,595","00:02:39,517"
that Bennett and I were supposed to go away together.,Client,neutral,undefined,485,2,2,11,"00:02:39,642","00:02:42,772"
"And, no, he didn't call saying he wants me back.",Client,neutral,undefined,485,3,2,11,"00:02:43,007","00:02:46,332"

Never mind. I already know.,Client,anger,undefined,485,11,2,11,"00:03:09,816","00:03:12,021"
My being late seems to have brought up quite a few feelings...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,485,12,2,11,"00:03:12,957","00:03:16,129"
So this is more of a home really than an office.,Client,anger,undefined,485,13,2,11,"00:03:16,322","00:03:18,959"
I think you said last week that you found it homey.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,485,14,2,11,"00:03:19,425","00:03:23,319"
"Homey,",Client,neutral,undefined,485,15,2,11,"00:03:24,403","00:03:25,403"

turn the heat down when you go away.,Client,neutral,undefined,485,17,2,11,"00:03:29,030","00:03:31,757"

What's going on?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,486,7,2,11,"00:04:10,942","00:04:12,192"
I don't want to be here.,Client,neutral,undefined,486,8,2,11,"00:04:13,145","00:04:15,299"

Too much brown.,Client,disgust,undefined,486,11,2,11,"00:04:19,809","00:04:21,065"
And this has absolutely nothing to do with the last week's session.,Client,disgust,undefined,486,12,2,11,"00:04:23,227","00:04:26,633"
Because I had not even had a chance to think about that.,Client,disgust,undefined,486,13,2,11,"00:04:26,758","00:04:29,183"
"Actually, I have,",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills,486,14,2,11,"00:04:29,353","00:04:30,617"

I was thinking about what you said at the door just before you left.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,486,16,2,11,"00:04:33,343","00:04:36,775"
"When I said, you owe me a child?",Client,anger,undefined,486,17,2,11,"00:04:37,896","00:04:39,933"
That was a joke.,Client,anger,undefined,486,18,2,11,"00:04:41,180","00:04:42,430"
Maybe it was.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,486,19,2,11,"00:04:43,036","00:04:43,948"
But I get the feeling that there might have been a little more to it than that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,486,20,2,11,"00:04:44,156","00:04:48,160"
"No, no, there wasn't. It was just a comment.",Client,anger,undefined,486,21,2,11,"00:04:49,905","00:04:52,842"
"Sometimes a comment is just a comment, right?",Client,anger,undefined,486,22,2,11,"00:04:52,967","00:04:55,733"

She did it to make you jealous. It doesn't take Freud to figure that out.,Client,neutral,undefined,488,3,2,11,"00:06:35,907","00:06:39,323"
She wanted to walk into her session,Client,neutral,undefined,488,4,2,11,"00:06:39,448","00:06:41,675"

but you cannot sing and hold your penis.,Client,joy,undefined,604,17,2,22,"00:09:43,402","00:09:46,398"
Everybody started laughing.,Client,joy,undefined,604,18,2,22,"00:09:47,649","00:09:49,880"
Then all the guys started singing and holding their own dicks.,Client,joy,undefined,604,19,2,22,"00:09:50,647","00:09:53,320"

"Her mom died when we were in high school,",Client,neutral,undefined,605,1,2,22,"00:10:04,106","00:10:05,819"

She's really more like a sister than a friend.,Client,neutral,undefined,605,3,2,22,"00:10:08,512","00:10:11,995"

"Yeah, so?",Client,joy,undefined,605,10,2,22,"00:10:33,201","00:10:34,384"

I have good taste in people.,Client,joy,undefined,605,12,2,22,"00:10:39,777","00:10:41,805"
I think it's more than that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,605,13,2,22,"00:10:42,265","00:10:43,809"

incredible loyalty.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,605,15,2,22,"00:10:47,884","00:10:49,334"

"Yes, I know that.",Therapist,neutral,Approval,605,20,2,22,"00:11:02,865","00:11:04,047"

I guess I just wonder why you work so hard to make friends who are...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,605,22,2,22,"00:11:09,537","00:11:13,143"

"when you need help, you seem reluctant to rely upon them.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,605,24,2,22,"00:11:18,522","00:11:22,140"
I called leah.,Client,anger,undefined,605,25,2,22,"00:11:22,265","00:11:23,336"
"Yeah, that's true,",Therapist,neutral,Approval,605,26,2,22,"00:11:23,848","00:11:25,309"
but you waited until you thought that you were dying.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,605,27,2,22,"00:11:25,557","00:11:28,989"
It's like a bank.,Client,neutral,undefined,606,0,2,22,"00:11:32,823","00:11:33,922"
"You keep taking money out,",Client,neutral,undefined,606,1,2,22,"00:11:35,255","00:11:37,490"
then eventually there'll be nothing left.,Client,neutral,undefined,606,2,2,22,"00:11:37,615","00:11:40,150"
So you think that there's only a limited amount of support,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,606,3,2,22,"00:11:40,878","00:11:43,235"
that one person can offer another,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,606,4,2,22,"00:11:43,357","00:11:45,032"
"and when that support is used up, it's gone forever?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement,606,5,2,22,"00:11:45,157","00:11:48,081"
"If Leah had cancer, would you get tired of helping her?",Therapist,neutral,Open question,606,6,2,22,"00:11:49,458","00:11:53,402"

What happened?,Client,neutral,undefined,607,6,2,22,"00:13:11,840","00:13:13,040"

You don't want to tell me?,Client,joy,undefined,607,10,2,22,"00:13:28,764","00:13:30,100"

"Hey, how old are you?",Client,neutral,undefined,607,15,2,22,"00:13:48,120","00:13:49,670"
A bit... a bit passed 50.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,607,16,2,22,"00:13:51,815","00:13:54,040"
"'Cause I was thinking this week, when...",Client,depression,undefined,607,17,2,22,"00:13:54,285","00:13:56,623"
When Leah's mom died she was 35...,Client,depression,undefined,607,18,2,22,"00:13:57,180","00:13:59,405"
We were 15 and she was 35... And I remember,Client,depression,undefined,607,19,2,22,"00:13:59,546","00:14:02,264"

"and Paul was 50, he seemed middle-aged.",Client,neutral,undefined,607,26,2,22,"00:14:20,200","00:14:22,707"
And now he seems so young.,Client,joy,undefined,607,27,2,22,"00:14:22,982","00:14:25,592"
You'll have to let me know when you get there.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,607,28,2,22,"00:14:27,697","00:14:29,951"
So we'll keep in touch?,Client,neutral,undefined,607,29,2,22,"00:14:31,462","00:14:33,112"
My hair started falling out.,Client,depression,undefined,608,0,2,22,"00:14:40,271","00:14:42,171"
They say I'll...,Client,depression,undefined,608,1,2,22,"00:14:44,205","00:14:45,679"
wake up one day next week and the rest of it will just,Client,depression,undefined,608,2,2,22,"00:14:46,798","00:14:49,997"
be there on the pillow.,Client,depression,undefined,608,3,2,22,"00:14:50,665","00:14:52,881"
It's gonna be hard to keep it from my parents after that happens.,Client,depression,undefined,608,4,2,22,"00:14:56,873","00:15:00,253"
I guess you and I should start strategizing.,Client,depression,undefined,608,5,2,22,"00:15:03,177","00:15:06,071"
Or maybe you could just tell them.,Client,depression,undefined,608,6,2,22,"00:15:07,597","00:15:09,324"
I bet you and my dad would actually get along.,Client,depression,undefined,608,7,2,22,"00:15:09,942","00:15:12,749"
You're both sort of intense in the same way.,Client,depression,undefined,608,8,2,22,"00:15:13,123","00:15:16,153"
I think you should be part of that conversation.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement,608,9,2,22,"00:15:16,413","00:15:19,033"
We could ask them to come with you to therapy.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement,608,10,2,22,"00:15:19,808","00:15:22,629"
That might work.,Client,neutral,undefined,608,11,2,22,"00:15:23,317","00:15:24,339"
We could schedule something before your next chemotherapy session.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement,608,12,2,22,"00:15:24,507","00:15:28,093"

Wouldn't you prefer if she took you?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,609,1,2,22,"00:15:50,048","00:15:52,518"
Do you not want to take me?,Client,depression,undefined,609,2,2,22,"00:15:59,854","00:16:01,140"
It's not a question of whether I want to take you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,609,3,2,22,"00:16:01,271","00:16:03,760"
"Okay, are you refusing to take me?",Client,anger,undefined,609,4,2,22,"00:16:03,885","00:16:05,482"
You still haven't told your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,609,5,2,22,"00:16:05,607","00:16:08,425"
So?,Client,anger,undefined,609,6,2,22,"00:16:05,607","00:16:08,425"

I don't want my mother to take me to chemo.,Client,anger,undefined,609,8,2,22,"00:16:12,405","00:16:14,658"

Because I want you to take me.,Client,anger,undefined,609,10,2,22,"00:16:14,783","00:16:18,018"
I think we should talk about why you still can't tell this to your parents.,Therapist,neutral,Advisement,609,11,2,22,"00:16:18,304","00:16:21,983"

No more dad. No more mom.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,712,23,2,31,"00:08:52,425","00:08:55,325"
Is this how closure works?,Client,anger,undefined,712,24,2,31,"00:08:52,425","00:08:55,325"

I was thinking about getting a parrot,Client,neutral,undefined,712,28,2,31,"00:09:07,589","00:09:09,989"
"as a pet,",Client,neutral,undefined,712,29,2,31,"00:09:11,349","00:09:12,299"
instead of a boyfriend or a therapist.,Client,neutral,undefined,712,30,2,31,"00:09:13,268","00:09:15,718"
I could name it paul,Client,neutral,undefined,713,0,2,31,"00:09:16,843","00:09:18,343"
"and I could teach it to say things like,",Client,neutral,undefined,713,1,2,31,"00:09:19,219","00:09:21,769"
what would you like to talk about?,Client,neutral,undefined,713,2,2,31,"00:09:22,089","00:09:23,729"
Or is it me or is it your father?,Client,neutral,undefined,713,3,2,31,"00:09:23,897","00:09:26,147"
But then I found out that parrots live for about 80 years.,Client,neutral,undefined,713,4,2,31,"00:09:26,825","00:09:29,722"

"So you want to go, but you also want to keep me around,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement,713,6,2,31,"00:09:32,701","00:09:35,087"

You're still angry about that.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,713,18,2,31,"00:10:07,941","00:10:10,901"
Maybe I'm just an angry person,Client,anger,undefined,713,19,2,31,"00:10:07,941","00:10:10,901"
and I should just accept myself for who I am.,Client,anger,undefined,713,20,2,31,"00:10:11,069","00:10:13,177"

"No, I said I like you.",Client,anger,undefined,713,22,2,31,"00:10:13,302","00:10:16,657"

but why you came back in the first place.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,713,27,2,31,"00:10:25,166","00:10:26,959"
You clearly knew that I was being sued for malpractice. And,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,713,28,2,31,"00:10:27,721","00:10:31,171"
you believed that I had failed you 20 years ago.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,713,29,2,31,"00:10:31,339","00:10:33,986"

Thank you.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills,740,2,2,35,"00:01:39,103","00:01:40,103"
I'd ask you where you were going,Client,neutral,undefined,740,3,2,35,"00:01:44,932","00:01:46,668"
but I know that you have your boundaries as a therapist.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,4,2,35,"00:01:46,793","00:01:50,143"
"Look, I hate to do this, I hate it when my patients do it,",Client,neutral,undefined,740,5,2,35,"00:02:04,149","00:02:07,599"

And...,Client,neutral,undefined,740,7,2,35,"00:02:12,087","00:02:13,106"
I'd rather be,Client,neutral,undefined,740,8,2,35,"00:02:15,128","00:02:16,278"
here,Client,neutral,undefined,740,9,2,35,"00:02:16,826","00:02:17,826"
"if it's bad news, okay?",Client,neutral,undefined,740,10,2,35,"00:02:18,896","00:02:21,244"
Sure.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills,740,11,2,35,"00:02:18,896","00:02:21,244"
I was so relieved that you didn't ask for the letter.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,12,2,35,"00:02:24,640","00:02:27,432"
I decided not to send it.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,13,2,35,"00:02:27,600","00:02:29,173"
"Yeah, I was having lunch",Client,neutral,undefined,740,14,2,35,"00:02:30,895","00:02:32,940"
with the kids last Sunday and Rosie actually asked me about the case.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,15,2,35,"00:02:33,555","00:02:37,442"
And I told her about the settlement offer,Client,neutral,undefined,740,16,2,35,"00:02:38,237","00:02:40,445"
"and she said, Dad, you can't do this.",Client,neutral,undefined,740,17,2,35,"00:02:40,613","00:02:43,063"
You can't confess to something you didn't do.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,18,2,35,"00:02:43,369","00:02:45,868"
You're the good guy.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,19,2,35,"00:02:45,993","00:02:47,437"
She'd been so rude to me all night about other stuff.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,20,2,35,"00:02:47,562","00:02:51,089"
I guess she's still angry about the divorce.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,21,2,35,"00:02:52,221","00:02:54,453"
"And then suddenly in one sentence, she made me feel better",Client,neutral,undefined,740,22,2,35,"00:02:54,861","00:02:57,275"
than I'd felt all week.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,23,2,35,"00:02:57,400","00:02:59,800"
I'm glad.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,24,2,35,"00:02:57,400","00:02:59,800"
So then I called my lawyer and I said I wasn't interested,Client,neutral,undefined,740,25,2,35,"00:02:59,925","00:03:03,259"
"in the settlement,",Client,neutral,undefined,740,26,2,35,"00:03:03,427","00:03:04,827"

this morning.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,28,2,35,"00:03:10,060","00:03:12,460"

I overslept.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,33,2,35,"00:03:21,070","00:03:23,170"
And why do you think you chose this morning to oversleep?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,740,34,2,35,"00:03:24,842","00:03:27,825"
"Yeah, the subconscious thing.",Client,neutral,undefined,740,35,2,35,"00:03:28,494","00:03:30,929"
Probably because I didn't want to go.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,36,2,35,"00:03:31,598","00:03:33,247"
And I just didn't feel like begging some judge to let me keep my job.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,37,2,35,"00:03:34,785","00:03:38,753"
You felt showing up would be begging?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,740,38,2,35,"00:03:39,197","00:03:41,005"
I don't know.,Client,neutral,undefined,740,39,2,35,"00:03:42,027","00:03:43,177"

You don't wanna talk about your own life?,Therapist,neutral,Guiding the Pace and Depth of the Conversation,741,3,2,35,"00:03:58,112","00:03:59,982"
Exactly.,Client,neutral,undefined,741,4,2,35,"00:04:00,150","00:04:01,150"

Did he say anything?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,741,6,2,35,"00:04:05,384","00:04:08,548"
"Yeah, he said not to quote him...",Client,neutral,undefined,741,7,2,35,"00:04:05,384","00:04:08,548"
'cause these guys hate to be quoted,Client,neutral,undefined,741,8,2,35,"00:04:08,673","00:04:10,973"
but he said that he thought,Client,neutral,undefined,741,9,2,35,"00:04:11,441","00:04:13,202"
that it went well.,Client,neutral,undefined,741,10,2,35,"00:04:14,465","00:04:16,415"
Did he say when you'd find out?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,741,11,2,35,"00:04:19,053","00:04:20,849"
Anytime between today and God-knows-when.,Client,neutral,undefined,741,12,2,35,"00:04:20,974","00:04:24,035"

"to be decided, yeah.",Client,neutral,undefined,741,16,2,35,"00:04:30,331","00:04:31,831"

You've been under enormous pressure.,Client,neutral,undefined,741,18,2,35,"00:04:34,993","00:04:36,811"
Is that why you dressed up?,Client,joy,undefined,742,0,2,35,"00:04:39,495","00:04:41,345"
That blue looks really really good on you.,Client,joy,undefined,742,1,2,35,"00:04:44,417","00:04:47,067"
It's the same color as the dress you had on that night,Client,joy,undefined,742,2,2,35,"00:04:47,900","00:04:50,574"
I saw you and David coming out of that club on the eastern shore.,Client,joy,undefined,742,3,2,35,"00:04:50,742","00:04:54,787"

I brought out the wrong car,Client,joy,undefined,742,10,2,35,"00:05:08,824","00:05:10,674"

"And I looked at him and I thought,",Client,joy,undefined,742,12,2,35,"00:05:14,265","00:05:16,306"
Of course. Why wouldn't she be with him?,Client,joy,undefined,742,13,2,35,"00:05:16,431","00:05:19,063"

"Practicing this way, I may never know whether I help people or not.",Client,neutral,undefined,746,10,2,35,"00:11:52,439","00:11:56,082"

or do better on their SATs or something.,Client,neutral,undefined,746,12,2,35,"00:12:00,770","00:12:03,044"
The only measure I have of whether I'm helping somebody or not,Client,neutral,undefined,746,13,2,35,"00:12:03,169","00:12:06,565"
is how my patients feel about it,Client,neutral,undefined,746,14,2,35,"00:12:07,351","00:12:09,451"
and how their lives,Client,neutral,undefined,746,15,2,35,"00:12:10,144","00:12:11,594"
go on from there.,Client,neutral,undefined,746,16,2,35,"00:12:12,370","00:12:14,112"

What are you saying?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,746,18,2,35,"00:12:18,314","00:12:21,484"

"these people come to me, they want me to fix their problems,",Client,neutral,undefined,746,20,2,35,"00:12:21,609","00:12:24,526"

"I don't think anybody's life can be figured out,",Client,neutral,undefined,746,23,2,35,"00:12:33,118","00:12:35,445"

I never got past the first step.,Client,neutral,undefined,755,26,3,2,"00:03:58,699","00:04:00,500"

You really helped her.,Client,neutral,undefined,756,12,3,2,"00:04:35,936","00:04:37,871"
And I think my sister felt,Client,neutral,undefined,756,13,3,2,"00:04:37,905","00:04:39,873"
Like I should be seeing someone too.,Client,neutral,undefined,756,14,3,2,"00:04:39,907","00:04:41,975"

I did happy days in London. Do you know it?,Client,anger,undefined,759,0,3,2,"00:07:25,806","00:07:27,774"
That's right.,Client,anger,undefined,759,1,3,2,"00:07:27,808","00:07:30,210"

"Yeah, he used to get a kick out of running lines with me.",Client,joy,undefined,759,10,3,2,"00:07:55,035","00:07:57,971"
I don't know. Maybe he just liked correcting me.,Client,joy,undefined,759,11,3,2,"00:07:58,005","00:08:01,107"
He used to lie in bed,Client,joy,undefined,759,12,3,2,"00:08:01,141","00:08:03,042"
And I'd pace back and forth around the room.,Client,joy,undefined,759,13,3,2,"00:08:03,077","00:08:05,912"
"He was like some kind of academic drill sergeant,",Client,joy,undefined,759,14,3,2,"00:08:05,946","00:08:08,681"

So he's not helping you anymore?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,759,19,3,2,"00:08:20,027","00:08:21,928"
"Oh, we divorced two years ago.",Client,anger,undefined,759,20,3,2,"00:08:21,962","00:08:23,730"
Yeah.,Client,anger,undefined,759,21,3,2,"00:08:23,764","00:08:24,998"
He was boffing one of his graduate students.,Client,anger,undefined,759,22,3,2,"00:08:25,032","00:08:27,467"
She dumped him six months later.,Client,anger,undefined,759,23,3,2,"00:08:27,501","00:08:29,536"

We alternate weekends and split up the week.,Client,neutral,undefined,760,7,3,2,"00:09:03,871","00:09:07,006"
I just thought she could stay with me,Client,neutral,undefined,760,8,3,2,"00:09:07,041","00:09:09,509"
Full-time while I was in rehearsal,Client,neutral,undefined,760,9,3,2,"00:09:09,543","00:09:11,477"
Because I'd be home at night.,Client,neutral,undefined,760,10,3,2,"00:09:11,512","00:09:13,179"
And then she could go to her father's,Client,neutral,undefined,760,11,3,2,"00:09:13,213","00:09:15,048"
When I was in tech and preview.,Client,neutral,undefined,760,12,3,2,"00:09:15,082","00:09:17,383"

Somebody wasn't happy with that.,Client,anger,undefined,760,14,3,2,"00:09:19,453","00:09:21,521"
Russell said Izzy felt manipulated by the change.,Client,anger,undefined,760,15,3,2,"00:09:21,555","00:09:25,491"

It was arranged.,Client,depression,undefined,800,23,3,5,"00:07:02,637","00:07:04,472"
I'd just graduated from the university.,Client,depression,undefined,800,24,3,5,"00:07:04,506","00:07:06,707"
She and her family came over to our home.,Client,depression,undefined,800,25,3,5,"00:07:06,741","00:07:10,044"
There was a short interview,Client,depression,undefined,800,26,3,5,"00:07:10,078","00:07:12,113"
Which lasted perhaps two hours.,Client,depression,undefined,800,27,3,5,"00:07:12,147","00:07:14,782"

When I presented my displeasure.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,2,3,5,"00:16:08,349","00:16:10,851"

"Many years ago, when he and Julia were first engaged.",Client,neutral,undefined,806,4,3,5,"00:16:12,487","00:16:16,423"
We had never met Julia.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,5,3,5,"00:16:16,457","00:16:18,558"
So they came to Calcutta to tell us the good news.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,6,3,5,"00:16:18,593","00:16:22,562"
You didn't see it that way?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,806,7,3,5,"00:16:22,597","00:16:24,665"

"For arun to receive so much attention,",Client,neutral,undefined,806,12,3,5,"00:16:34,342","00:16:36,743"

I thought kamala was going to faint.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,17,3,5,"00:16:50,525","00:16:52,292"
And how did things go between kamala and Julia?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,806,18,3,5,"00:16:52,326","00:16:54,795"
Very bad.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,19,3,5,"00:16:54,829","00:16:56,596"
Mm-hmm.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,20,3,5,"00:16:54,829","00:16:56,596"
Toward the end of dinner Julia expressed her disappointment,Client,neutral,undefined,806,21,3,5,"00:16:56,631","00:16:59,266"
That we would not allow her to stay at our home.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,22,3,5,"00:16:59,300","00:17:01,668"
So where was she staying?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,806,23,3,5,"00:17:01,703","00:17:04,037"
In a hotel.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,24,3,5,"00:17:05,807","00:17:06,940"

"He stayed with us, in his old room.",Client,neutral,undefined,806,26,3,5,"00:17:09,410","00:17:11,845"
You must understand,Client,neutral,undefined,806,27,3,5,"00:17:11,879","00:17:13,847"
It's not acceptable,Client,neutral,undefined,806,28,3,5,"00:17:13,881","00:17:15,849"
For a couple to sleep,Client,neutral,undefined,806,29,3,5,"00:17:15,883","00:17:17,851"
In the House of the parents before they are married.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,30,3,5,"00:17:17,885","00:17:20,921"
So during dinner it was clear,Client,neutral,undefined,806,31,3,5,"00:17:20,955","00:17:23,724"
She wanted arun to discuss these matters with us.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,32,3,5,"00:17:23,758","00:17:27,661"
"So when arun could not bring himself to do it,",Client,neutral,undefined,806,33,3,5,"00:17:27,695","00:17:32,265"
She proceeded to do so herself.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,34,3,5,"00:17:32,300","00:17:34,601"
She said they had traveled such a far distance,Client,neutral,undefined,806,35,3,5,"00:17:34,635","00:17:37,437"
And they are very tired,Client,neutral,undefined,806,36,3,5,"00:17:37,472","00:17:39,439"

"Arun was so embarrassed,",Client,neutral,undefined,806,38,3,5,"00:17:41,609","00:17:44,010"
He could not even look at his mother and me.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,39,3,5,"00:17:44,045","00:17:47,114"
How did you and your wife respond to that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,806,40,3,5,"00:17:47,148","00:17:50,016"
"After arun left to escort Julia back to her hotel,",Client,neutral,undefined,806,41,3,5,"00:17:50,051","00:17:54,254"
"Kamala was so angry,",Client,neutral,undefined,806,42,3,5,"00:17:54,288","00:17:56,356"
She could not speak for more than one hour.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,43,3,5,"00:17:56,390","00:18:00,961"
Then she pleaded with me to speak to arun.,Client,neutral,undefined,806,44,3,5,"00:18:00,995","00:18:03,497"
"So the next night, I sat in the kitchen with arun",Client,neutral,undefined,807,0,3,5,"00:18:03,531","00:18:06,099"
And asked him whether he...,Client,neutral,undefined,807,1,3,5,"00:18:06,134","00:18:08,101"
Whether he was sure about his decision to marry.,Client,neutral,undefined,807,2,3,5,"00:18:08,136","00:18:11,338"
What did he say?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,807,3,3,5,"00:18:11,372","00:18:14,007"
He lashed out at me.,Client,anger,undefined,807,4,3,5,"00:18:14,041","00:18:15,976"
He said we did not approve of Julia,Client,anger,undefined,807,5,3,5,"00:18:16,010","00:18:19,880"
Because... because she's not Bengali.,Client,anger,undefined,807,6,3,5,"00:18:19,914","00:18:22,015"
And he said I could not relate to his life,Client,anger,undefined,807,7,3,5,"00:18:22,049","00:18:24,718"
And I married a woman I did not love,Client,anger,undefined,807,8,3,5,"00:18:24,752","00:18:26,753"
And I... I chose duty over passion,Client,anger,undefined,807,9,3,5,"00:18:26,788","00:18:30,257"
And... and...,Client,anger,undefined,807,10,3,5,"00:18:30,291","00:18:32,259"
And I'm jealous.,Client,anger,undefined,807,11,3,5,"00:18:32,293","00:18:35,462"
So they cut their visit short by three days,Client,anger,undefined,807,12,3,5,"00:18:35,496","00:18:38,198"
And left to America the following morning.,Client,anger,undefined,807,13,3,5,"00:18:38,232","00:18:41,101"
So do you think there was any truth in what arun said?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,807,14,3,5,"00:18:41,135","00:18:44,171"
That I do not know passion?,Client,neutral,undefined,807,15,3,5,"00:18:44,205","00:18:47,007"

"For the same reasons as my son,",Client,neutral,undefined,808,1,3,5,"00:18:55,216","00:18:58,351"

It's called the memory of running.,Client,neutral,undefined,854,17,3,8,"00:26:15,848","00:26:18,716"
"She hasn't read it yet,",Client,neutral,undefined,854,18,3,8,"00:26:18,750","00:26:21,052"
But she still thinks it's about running,Client,joy,undefined,854,19,3,8,"00:26:21,086","00:26:25,588"
It's not?,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills,854,20,3,8,"00:26:25,623","00:26:28,791"
Have a good week.,Client,joy,undefined,854,21,3,8,"00:26:32,262","00:26:34,362"
The shopkeeper gave me clear instruction,Client,neutral,undefined,855,0,3,9,"00:02:01,033","00:02:03,001"
That it should not steep more than three minutes,Client,neutral,undefined,855,1,3,9,"00:02:03,035","00:02:05,136"
Or the tea will turn bitter.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,2,3,9,"00:02:05,171","00:02:07,205"
It smells a bit like roasted peanuts.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills,855,3,3,9,"00:02:07,239","00:02:10,709"
"Oh, it will be much more pleasing, believe me.",Client,neutral,undefined,855,4,3,9,"00:02:10,743","00:02:13,144"
"Oh, by the way, you...",Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills,855,5,3,9,"00:02:17,016","00:02:20,452"

But I haven't seen it.,Therapist,neutral,Communication Skills,855,11,3,9,"00:02:37,536","00:02:40,205"
What it is... two teams of American citizens,Client,neutral,undefined,855,12,3,9,"00:02:40,239","00:02:42,974"
Are stranded on an island.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,13,3,9,"00:02:43,008","00:02:44,743"
And they compete in the most unpleasant conditions.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,14,3,9,"00:02:44,777","00:02:49,013"
There's no food.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,15,3,9,"00:02:49,014","00:02:50,648"
And they compete in they have to pleasant costruggle for water.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,16,3,9,"00:02:50,683","00:02:53,017"
They have to battle for water.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,17,3,9,"00:02:53,052","00:02:54,719"
And the women walking and jumping around naked...,Client,neutral,undefined,855,18,3,9,"00:02:54,754","00:02:57,856"
"Almost naked, practically naked, without dignity.",Client,neutral,undefined,855,19,3,9,"00:02:57,890","00:03:00,058"
And during competition,Client,neutral,undefined,855,20,3,9,"00:03:00,092","00:03:02,026"
They fight each other in the mud,Client,neutral,undefined,855,21,3,9,"00:03:02,061","00:03:04,195"
And run like crazed animals.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,22,3,9,"00:03:04,230","00:03:06,398"
"And they do all this willingly, Paul.",Client,neutral,undefined,855,23,3,9,"00:03:06,432","00:03:10,001"
Did you find that disturbing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,855,24,3,9,"00:03:10,035","00:03:11,870"
"I could not help imagining what their husbands,",Client,neutral,undefined,855,25,3,9,"00:03:11,904","00:03:15,240"
"Wives and children must think, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined,855,26,3,9,"00:03:15,274","00:03:17,342"
They are willing to compromise,Client,neutral,undefined,855,27,3,9,"00:03:17,376","00:03:20,145"
Any principle they might possess,Client,neutral,undefined,855,28,3,9,"00:03:20,179","00:03:22,180"
For one million dollars.,Client,neutral,undefined,855,29,3,9,"00:03:22,214","00:03:24,149"
I suppose this is the cost of one's dignity in America...,Client,neutral,undefined,856,0,3,9,"00:03:24,183","00:03:27,752"
One million dollars.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,1,3,9,"00:03:27,787","00:03:29,988"

That it might tempt you to lose your own dignity?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,856,5,3,9,"00:03:39,932","00:03:43,101"
I would not worry about that.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,6,3,9,"00:03:45,104","00:03:46,871"
So are you planning to watch the show again?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,856,7,3,9,"00:03:46,906","00:03:49,774"
"Thursday, 9:00 P.M.",Client,neutral,undefined,856,8,3,9,"00:03:55,381","00:03:57,482"
I was just thinking this is the first time,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,856,9,3,9,"00:03:57,516","00:04:00,218"

Such excitement from you.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,856,11,3,9,"00:04:02,288","00:04:04,556"
Excitement? I was repelled.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,12,3,9,"00:04:04,590","00:04:06,658"
"Yes, but you must have been kind of fascinated too.",Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,856,13,3,9,"00:04:06,692","00:04:09,394"
And you even wrote down the time that it airs,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,856,14,3,9,"00:04:09,428","00:04:13,965"
So that you can watch it again.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,856,15,3,9,"00:04:13,999","00:04:16,267"

Why?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,856,22,3,9,"00:04:38,724","00:04:40,859"

To make an attempt to be different.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,24,3,9,"00:04:40,893","00:04:42,961"
How so?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,856,25,3,9,"00:04:42,995","00:04:44,529"
I have been thinking,Client,neutral,undefined,856,26,3,9,"00:04:42,995","00:04:44,529"
Quite a lot about your exercise...,Client,neutral,undefined,856,27,3,9,"00:04:44,563","00:04:46,397"
How I should begin,Client,neutral,undefined,856,28,3,9,"00:04:46,432","00:04:48,366"
To express my frustration.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,29,3,9,"00:04:48,400","00:04:51,469"
This is not easy.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,30,3,9,"00:04:51,504","00:04:53,171"
It's like learning to bowl a cricket ball,Client,neutral,undefined,856,31,3,9,"00:04:53,205","00:04:55,573"
With your opposite hand.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,32,3,9,"00:04:55,608","00:04:57,475"
It makes your head feel very heavy.,Client,neutral,undefined,856,33,3,9,"00:04:57,510","00:04:59,978"
"Well, I'm really glad",Therapist,neutral,Approval,856,34,3,9,"00:05:00,012","00:05:01,946"
That you've been trying to do something different.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,856,35,3,9,"00:05:01,981","00:05:04,716"
Two nights ago,Client,neutral,undefined,857,0,3,9,"00:05:07,152","00:05:09,087"
Julia was in her exercise room,Client,neutral,undefined,857,1,3,9,"00:05:09,121","00:05:12,724"
"On the second floor, right?",Client,neutral,undefined,857,2,3,9,"00:05:12,758","00:05:15,426"
"So I was trying to read,",Client,neutral,undefined,857,3,3,9,"00:05:15,461","00:05:17,428"
But I could not concentrate,Client,neutral,undefined,857,4,3,9,"00:05:17,463","00:05:19,430"
Because her music was so loud.,Client,neutral,undefined,857,5,3,9,"00:05:19,465","00:05:21,666"
I could... I could feel it,Client,neutral,undefined,857,6,3,9,"00:05:21,700","00:05:24,435"
"Vibrating through the floor, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined,857,7,3,9,"00:05:24,470","00:05:27,038"
So I thought I'll go down and ask her,Client,neutral,undefined,857,8,3,9,"00:05:27,072","00:05:29,607"
If she could please turn the music down a little bit.,Client,neutral,undefined,857,9,3,9,"00:05:29,642","00:05:33,011"
"But I could not bring myself to do this, Paul,",Client,depression,undefined,857,10,3,9,"00:05:33,045","00:05:36,047"
"Because she was running, bending, dancing, sweating so much",Client,depression,undefined,857,11,3,9,"00:05:36,081","00:05:39,784"
That I did not want to embarrass her.,Client,depression,undefined,857,12,3,9,"00:05:39,818","00:05:42,720"
"Julia was like a desperate animal,",Client,disgust,undefined,857,13,3,9,"00:05:42,755","00:05:46,457"
Wanting so badly to keep up.,Client,disgust,undefined,857,14,3,9,"00:05:46,492","00:05:48,693"
She was even punishing herself when she could not.,Client,disgust,undefined,857,15,3,9,"00:05:48,727","00:05:51,496"
"She was yelling, come on, Julia. Julia, come on.",Client,disgust,undefined,857,16,3,9,"00:05:51,530","00:05:54,465"

"So out of breath, you know.",Client,disgust,undefined,857,19,3,9,"00:05:59,138","00:06:00,939"
Doom-doom doom-doom doom-doom doom-doom... constant.,Client,neutral,undefined,857,20,3,9,"00:06:00,973","00:06:04,309"
I have never seen her in that state before.,Client,neutral,undefined,857,21,3,9,"00:06:04,343","00:06:08,713"
So you watched her for... for quite a while then.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,857,22,3,9,"00:06:08,747","00:06:12,283"
I suppose you find this amusing.,Client,neutral,undefined,857,23,3,9,"00:06:15,921","00:06:18,556"
Why would I find it amusing?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,857,24,3,9,"00:06:20,192","00:06:22,760"
The ways in which I choose to spend my time.,Client,neutral,undefined,857,25,3,9,"00:06:22,795","00:06:25,597"
I do think it's interesting,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,857,26,3,9,"00:06:25,631","00:06:27,565"
That you described Julia in the same way that you described,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,857,27,3,9,"00:06:27,600","00:06:31,169"
The female television contestants...,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,857,28,3,9,"00:06:31,203","00:06:33,871"
"Desperate, primal, like crazed animals.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement,857,29,3,9,"00:06:33,906","00:06:38,142"

You still kept watching.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,857,31,3,9,"00:06:42,514","00:06:44,549"
"And I can't help but notice how your energy,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,857,32,3,9,"00:06:44,583","00:06:46,918"
When you talk about this TV show...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,857,33,3,9,"00:06:46,952","00:06:49,020"
I see the same kind of excitement,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,857,34,3,9,"00:06:49,054","00:06:51,656"
When you talk about... about Julia.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,857,35,3,9,"00:06:51,690","00:06:56,494"
"My excitement, you said?",Client,neutral,undefined,858,0,3,9,"00:06:56,528","00:06:58,496"
I think that's accurate.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,858,1,3,9,"00:06:58,530","00:07:00,732"
"The last time you were here,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement,858,2,3,9,"00:07:12,044","00:07:13,978"
You spoke about arun and Julia's first visit to Calcutta.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,858,3,3,9,"00:07:14,013","00:07:18,383"
Do you remember how you described him...,Therapist,neutral,Open question,858,4,3,9,"00:07:18,417","00:07:20,685"

Barely able to breathe?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,858,7,3,9,"00:07:25,591","00:07:27,425"
Quite a vivid image.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,858,8,3,9,"00:07:27,459","00:07:29,027"
And it just came back to me now,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,858,9,3,9,"00:07:29,061","00:07:30,728"
As you were telling that story.,Therapist,neutral,Self-disclosure,858,10,3,9,"00:07:30,763","00:07:32,530"
"Initially you said you were happy for arun,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,858,11,3,9,"00:07:32,564","00:07:35,767"
That you shared his excitement about Julia. Would you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,858,12,3,9,"00:07:35,801","00:07:38,970"
"My son, I think, seemed amazed, surprised",Client,disgust,undefined,858,13,3,9,"00:07:39,004","00:07:43,675"
That a woman like Julia agreed to be his wife.,Client,disgust,undefined,858,14,3,9,"00:07:43,709","00:07:46,344"
A woman like Julia... what do you mean by that?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,858,15,3,9,"00:07:46,378","00:07:49,580"
Let me explain it to you in this way...,Client,neutral,undefined,858,16,3,9,"00:07:49,615","00:07:51,816"
"When arun was away at school,",Client,neutral,undefined,858,17,3,9,"00:07:51,850","00:07:54,686"
His mother kamala...,Client,neutral,undefined,858,18,3,9,"00:07:54,720","00:07:56,654"
She had identified a Bengali girl,Client,neutral,undefined,858,19,3,9,"00:07:56,689","00:08:01,459"
That she thought would be a good match for him.,Client,neutral,undefined,858,20,3,9,"00:08:01,493","00:08:03,995"
"She came from a very well-respected Brahmin family,",Client,neutral,undefined,859,0,3,9,"00:08:04,029","00:08:07,031"
But she was somewhat fat and not terribly bright.,Client,neutral,undefined,859,1,3,9,"00:08:07,066","00:08:10,234"
And her name was Amolika.,Client,neutral,undefined,859,2,3,9,"00:08:10,269","00:08:12,637"
Her face was like a giant bullfrog.,Client,neutral,undefined,859,3,3,9,"00:08:12,671","00:08:15,707"
So now Julia is,Client,neutral,undefined,859,4,3,9,"00:08:15,741","00:08:18,810"
"A great contrast to Amolika, you know.",Client,neutral,undefined,859,5,3,9,"00:08:18,844","00:08:22,146"
You have seen her in person.,Client,neutral,undefined,859,6,3,9,"00:08:22,181","00:08:23,948"
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,859,7,3,9,"00:08:22,181","00:08:23,948"
She's...  she's not like a bullfrog.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,859,8,3,9,"00:08:23,982","00:08:26,918"

She's quite beautiful.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,859,10,3,9,"00:08:26,952","00:08:28,820"
Do you think she's beautiful?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,859,11,3,9,"00:08:30,789","00:08:33,791"
It was clear that,Client,neutral,undefined,859,12,3,9,"00:08:33,826","00:08:36,360"
Arun felt fortunate to be with her.,Client,neutral,undefined,859,13,3,9,"00:08:36,395","00:08:38,863"

"He had to be near her all the time,",Client,disgust,undefined,859,15,3,9,"00:08:41,200","00:08:45,670"
As if he had to be touching her,Client,disgust,undefined,859,16,3,9,"00:08:45,704","00:08:47,939"
Or she would disappear.,Client,disgust,undefined,859,17,3,9,"00:08:47,973","00:08:51,142"
"When they were being affectionate with each other,",Therapist,neutral,Open question,859,18,3,9,"00:08:52,611","00:08:54,746"
Was that hard for you to watch?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,859,19,3,9,"00:08:54,780","00:08:58,149"
It was more than just affection.,Client,depression,undefined,859,20,3,9,"00:09:00,786","00:09:05,723"
"One evening at supper, we all were sitting.",Client,depression,undefined,859,21,3,9,"00:09:07,126","00:09:11,629"
Julia kept adjusting her sari...,Client,depression,undefined,859,22,3,9,"00:09:11,663","00:09:15,333"
She borrowed it from kamala.,Client,depression,undefined,859,23,3,9,"00:09:15,367","00:09:17,034"
"Because it was large for her,",Client,depression,undefined,859,24,3,9,"00:09:17,069","00:09:19,737"
It was falling off her shoulder.,Client,depression,undefined,859,25,3,9,"00:09:19,772","00:09:21,506"
It could be a very difficult wear,Client,depression,undefined,859,26,3,9,"00:09:21,540","00:09:23,608"
For a new person.,Client,depression,undefined,859,27,3,9,"00:09:23,642","00:09:25,977"
"So arun tried to help her several times,",Client,depression,undefined,860,0,3,9,"00:09:26,011","00:09:30,615"
His hands grazing her bare skin.,Client,depression,undefined,860,1,3,9,"00:09:30,649","00:09:33,918"
Julia... more than once,Client,depression,undefined,860,2,3,9,"00:09:33,952","00:09:36,420"
She nudged him with her elbow,Client,depression,undefined,860,3,3,9,"00:09:36,455","00:09:40,024"
In a very playful manner.,Client,depression,undefined,860,4,3,9,"00:09:40,058","00:09:42,527"
Kamala saw it and she was so embarrassed,Client,depression,undefined,860,5,3,9,"00:09:42,561","00:09:45,797"
"That, you know, she excused herself from the table.",Client,depression,undefined,860,6,3,9,"00:09:45,831","00:09:48,299"
Were you embarrassed as well?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,860,7,3,9,"00:09:48,333","00:09:50,635"
I managed to stay at the table.,Client,depression,undefined,860,8,3,9,"00:09:50,669","00:09:54,739"
So the following morning...,Client,depression,undefined,860,9,3,9,"00:09:56,775","00:09:58,910"
"The moment arun woke up,",Client,depression,undefined,860,10,3,9,"00:10:10,622","00:10:13,157"
He went to meet Julia at the hotel.,Client,depression,undefined,860,11,3,9,"00:10:13,192","00:10:15,593"
"Now Julia wanted to do some kind of shopping,",Client,depression,undefined,860,12,3,9,"00:10:15,627","00:10:18,429"
So we planned to meet her at the hotel at lunch.,Client,depression,undefined,860,13,3,9,"00:10:18,463","00:10:23,100"
"We waited nearly 10 minutes down in the lobby,",Client,depression,undefined,860,14,3,9,"00:10:24,670","00:10:27,338"
Then I went up to the room.,Client,depression,undefined,860,15,3,9,"00:10:27,372","00:10:31,309"
So I heard some unusual noises.,Client,depression,undefined,860,16,3,9,"00:10:33,478","00:10:36,214"
At first I thought,Client,depression,undefined,860,17,3,9,"00:10:36,248","00:10:38,182"
It's the sound of Julia weeping.,Client,depression,undefined,860,18,3,9,"00:10:38,217","00:10:40,284"
Then I realized...,Client,depression,undefined,860,19,3,9,"00:10:40,319","00:10:43,054"
My son's voice as well.,Client,depression,undefined,860,20,3,9,"00:10:43,088","00:10:45,556"
You heard them... you heard them talking?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,860,21,3,9,"00:10:45,591","00:10:48,726"
Not talking.,Client,depression,undefined,860,22,3,9,"00:10:48,760","00:10:50,661"
They were engaged...,Client,depression,undefined,860,23,3,9,"00:10:53,065","00:10:55,199"
"I mean, intimate.",Client,depression,undefined,860,24,3,9,"00:10:57,736","00:11:00,671"
"And the things they were saying to each other, Paul...",Client,depression,undefined,860,25,3,9,"00:11:06,144","00:11:09,313"
"Anyway, so...",Client,depression,undefined,860,26,3,9,"00:11:18,690","00:11:22,126"
I simply stood there.,Client,depression,undefined,860,27,3,9,"00:11:22,160","00:11:23,928"
"And eventually kamala came up and she said,",Client,depression,undefined,860,28,3,9,"00:11:23,962","00:11:27,331"
do you realize how long you were gone?,Client,depression,undefined,860,29,3,9,"00:11:27,366","00:11:29,834"
And then she heard them as well.,Client,depression,undefined,860,30,3,9,"00:11:29,868","00:11:32,803"
How long had you been gone?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,860,31,3,9,"00:11:32,838","00:11:34,639"
It was terrible terrible terrible...,Client,disgust,undefined,860,32,3,9,"00:11:34,673","00:11:36,974"
The look on her face.,Client,disgust,undefined,860,33,3,9,"00:11:37,009","00:11:39,143"
She just turned and ran to the elevator.,Client,disgust,undefined,861,0,3,9,"00:11:39,177","00:11:43,814"
After that we didn't sleep for whole two days.,Client,disgust,undefined,861,1,3,9,"00:11:46,051","00:11:49,353"
And I've never seen kamala so so angry and so upset.,Client,disgust,undefined,861,2,3,9,"00:11:49,388","00:11:53,424"
Kamala truly felt that arun was making,Client,disgust,undefined,861,3,3,9,"00:11:53,458","00:11:55,726"
The biggest mistake of his life.,Client,disgust,undefined,861,4,3,9,"00:11:55,761","00:11:58,162"
So was this the event,Therapist,neutral,Open question,861,5,3,9,"00:11:58,196","00:12:00,831"
That precipitated your conversation with arun?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,861,6,3,9,"00:12:00,866","00:12:05,469"
Were you as passionately against their engagement as kamala?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,861,7,3,9,"00:12:05,504","00:12:10,141"
"Paul, see, this is not acceptable behavior",Client,disgust,undefined,861,8,3,9,"00:12:10,175","00:12:13,144"
"For principled Bengali people, Paul.",Client,disgust,undefined,861,9,3,9,"00:12:13,178","00:12:17,248"
"Making love in a hotel, huh?",Client,disgust,undefined,861,10,3,9,"00:12:17,282","00:12:20,484"
Moments before you are to meet your parents for lunch?,Client,disgust,undefined,861,11,3,9,"00:12:20,519","00:12:24,088"
"You know, he is... he is our only child.",Client,disgust,undefined,861,12,3,9,"00:12:25,958","00:12:28,893"
"Yet when you first met Julia, you were excited for him.",Therapist,neutral,Restatement,861,13,3,9,"00:12:28,927","00:12:31,762"
I was excited because he was excited.,Client,anger,undefined,861,14,3,9,"00:12:31,797","00:12:33,831"
But kamala was right...,Client,anger,undefined,861,15,3,9,"00:12:33,865","00:12:35,933"
"Julia is not a good match for arun,",Client,anger,undefined,861,16,3,9,"00:12:35,968","00:12:39,136"
And this is obvious to me now.,Client,anger,undefined,861,17,3,9,"00:12:39,171","00:12:42,073"
And Thursday night,Client,neutral,undefined,862,0,3,9,"00:12:53,218","00:12:56,253"
Was the anniversary of my marriage to kamala.,Client,neutral,undefined,862,1,3,9,"00:12:56,288","00:12:59,924"
So arun and me prepared a garland of flowers...,Client,neutral,undefined,862,2,3,9,"00:12:59,958","00:13:04,228"
A beautiful garland of flowers,Client,neutral,undefined,862,3,3,9,"00:13:04,262","00:13:06,630"
Which we arranged on Kamala's photo.,Client,neutral,undefined,862,4,3,9,"00:13:06,665","00:13:08,966"
We also prepared her favorite meal...,Client,neutral,undefined,862,5,3,9,"00:13:09,001","00:13:11,002"
Lamb curry.,Client,joy,undefined,862,6,3,9,"00:13:11,036","00:13:13,070"
So...,Client,neutral,undefined,862,7,3,9,"00:13:13,105","00:13:15,940"
Julia came. She came and took one bite,Client,neutral,undefined,862,8,3,9,"00:13:15,974","00:13:19,977"
And then left the rest untouched.,Client,disgust,undefined,862,9,3,9,"00:13:20,012","00:13:24,382"
I thought maybe she didn't like it.,Client,disgust,undefined,862,10,3,9,"00:13:24,416","00:13:27,051"
"It turned out she was saving her appetite,",Client,disgust,undefined,862,11,3,9,"00:13:27,085","00:13:30,321"
"Going to a big dinner for a young author, Ethan Barr.",Client,disgust,undefined,862,12,3,9,"00:13:30,355","00:13:34,258"
And this upset arun?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,862,13,3,9,"00:13:34,292","00:13:36,660"
It was his parents' anniversary.,Client,anger,undefined,862,14,3,9,"00:13:36,695","00:13:38,129"
"Yes, I understand that. But did it upset him?",Therapist,neutral,Approval,862,15,3,9,"00:13:38,163","00:13:41,999"
It clearly upset you.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,862,16,3,9,"00:13:42,034","00:13:44,335"
I think it's terribly terribly unfortunate for arun,Client,anger,undefined,862,17,3,9,"00:13:44,369","00:13:47,605"
That Julia places her personal desires ahead of her family.,Client,anger,undefined,862,18,3,9,"00:13:47,639","00:13:51,742"
Personal desires?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,862,19,3,9,"00:13:51,777","00:13:53,511"
But it sounds like she had...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,862,20,3,9,"00:13:53,545","00:13:55,946"
That she had a professional obligation.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,862,21,3,9,"00:13:55,981","00:13:58,349"
"This Ethan Barr is quite young and successful,",Client,anger,undefined,862,22,3,9,"00:13:58,383","00:14:00,918"
And he looks more like a movie star than an author of a book.,Client,anger,undefined,862,23,3,9,"00:14:00,952","00:14:04,388"
the pale fox by Ethan Barr.,Client,anger,undefined,862,24,3,9,"00:14:04,423","00:14:08,726"
Julia calls him several times a day.,Client,disgust,undefined,863,0,3,9,"00:14:09,861","00:14:12,530"
They even talk on the weekend.,Client,disgust,undefined,863,1,3,9,"00:14:12,564","00:14:15,533"
She left Kamala's dinner,Client,disgust,undefined,863,2,3,9,"00:14:20,872","00:14:22,940"
Wearing extremely short dress...,Client,disgust,undefined,863,3,3,9,"00:14:22,974","00:14:26,577"

With her hair flatteringly styled.,Client,disgust,undefined,863,5,3,9,"00:14:30,549","00:14:33,250"

For this young writer?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,863,7,3,9,"00:14:35,854","00:14:38,089"
"As she was exiting the house,",Client,neutral,undefined,863,8,3,9,"00:14:38,123","00:14:39,957"
I was sitting alone at the table,Client,neutral,undefined,863,9,3,9,"00:14:39,991","00:14:41,926"
Looking at Kamala's photo.,Client,neutral,undefined,863,10,3,9,"00:14:41,960","00:14:43,994"
"So she came and sat next to me,",Client,neutral,undefined,863,11,3,9,"00:14:44,029","00:14:47,731"
And she looked me in the eyes.,Client,neutral,undefined,863,12,3,9,"00:14:47,766","00:14:51,035"
She took my hand,Client,neutral,undefined,863,13,3,9,"00:14:51,069","00:14:53,037"
And kissed my cheek,Client,neutral,undefined,863,14,3,9,"00:14:53,071","00:14:55,072"
And said she was sorry about kamala.,Client,neutral,undefined,863,15,3,9,"00:14:57,008","00:15:00,044"
And she was wearing this perfume,Client,disgust,undefined,863,16,3,9,"00:15:00,078","00:15:02,580"
"Which was very strong,",Client,disgust,undefined,863,17,3,9,"00:15:02,614","00:15:04,381"
Just like black pepper and Jasmine.,Client,disgust,undefined,863,18,3,9,"00:15:04,416","00:15:07,218"
Arun spent the evening with the children.,Client,disgust,undefined,863,19,3,9,"00:15:08,787","00:15:10,754"
"He gave them their baths,",Client,disgust,undefined,863,20,3,9,"00:15:10,789","00:15:12,790"
Put them to bed.,Client,disgust,undefined,863,21,3,9,"00:15:12,824","00:15:14,358"

Wearing this perfume.,Client,anger,undefined,863,24,3,9,"00:15:19,464","00:15:22,633"
Must have been quite a surprise,Therapist,neutral,Approval,863,25,3,9,"00:15:22,667","00:15:24,602"

as if it is David Copperfield.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,3,3,13,"00:03:57,776","00:03:59,910"
"Oh, how pitch-perfect it is.",Client,neutral,undefined,902,4,3,13,"00:03:59,945","00:04:02,813"
Oh genius. Genius.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,5,3,13,"00:04:02,848","00:04:07,084"
"So when you went into Julia's study,",Therapist,neutral,Restatement,902,6,3,13,"00:04:07,118","00:04:09,920"
is that what you were looking for... Ethan Barr's manuscript?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,902,7,3,13,"00:04:09,955","00:04:13,157"
It is supposedly about a young boy,Client,neutral,undefined,902,8,3,13,"00:04:13,191","00:04:15,559"
who gets lost in a cave,Client,neutral,undefined,902,9,3,13,"00:04:15,594","00:04:18,295"
and who discovers a group,Client,neutral,undefined,902,10,3,13,"00:04:18,330","00:04:20,865"
of displaced American veterans from the Iraq war,Client,neutral,undefined,902,11,3,13,"00:04:20,899","00:04:24,835"
who are inventing a game,Client,neutral,undefined,902,12,3,13,"00:04:24,870","00:04:27,538"
using a giant ball,Client,neutral,undefined,902,13,3,13,"00:04:27,572","00:04:30,908"
made of their shaved hair and shoelaces.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,14,3,13,"00:04:30,942","00:04:34,745"
And she goes on and on about how the men,Client,neutral,undefined,902,15,3,13,"00:04:34,779","00:04:38,749"
who are inventing the game are so heartbreaking,Client,neutral,undefined,902,16,3,13,"00:04:38,783","00:04:42,019"
because they are trying to regain their innocence,Client,neutral,undefined,902,17,3,13,"00:04:42,053","00:04:45,256"
and playing this game would somehow reverse,Client,neutral,undefined,902,18,3,13,"00:04:45,290","00:04:48,526"
all the terrible things they did in the war.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,19,3,13,"00:04:48,560","00:04:52,596"
So apparently they teach the boy how to play the game.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,20,3,13,"00:04:52,631","00:04:56,433"
And then the boy teaches them,Client,neutral,undefined,902,21,3,13,"00:04:56,468","00:04:58,402"
how to become boys again.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,22,3,13,"00:04:58,470","00:05:01,772"
See how pitch-perfect it is?,Client,neutral,undefined,902,23,3,13,"00:05:01,806","00:05:05,009"
Did you consider asking your daughter-in-law,Therapist,neutral,Open question,902,24,3,13,"00:05:05,043","00:05:07,144"
if you could read the book?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,902,25,3,13,"00:05:07,178","00:05:09,380"
Did you read it?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,902,26,3,13,"00:05:09,414","00:05:10,881"
"No, I... I... I did not locate it.",Client,neutral,undefined,902,27,3,13,"00:05:10,916","00:05:13,851"
But I can assure you this is ridiculous.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,28,3,13,"00:05:13,885","00:05:18,656"
Yet you still felt compelled,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,902,29,3,13,"00:05:18,690","00:05:21,191"
"to search for it in Julia's study, yeah?",Therapist,neutral,Restatement,902,30,3,13,"00:05:21,226","00:05:24,795"
And this is what I found.,Client,neutral,undefined,902,31,3,13,"00:05:24,829","00:05:26,797"
And this is an absolute proof,Client,neutral,undefined,903,0,3,13,"00:05:26,831","00:05:29,133"
that Julia is having an affair,Client,neutral,undefined,903,1,3,13,"00:05:29,167","00:05:31,135"
"with Mr. pale fox, a.K.A. Ethan Barr.",Client,neutral,undefined,903,2,3,13,"00:05:31,169","00:05:35,673"
Don't you think it's at all possible,Therapist,neutral,Open question,903,3,3,13,"00:05:35,707","00:05:38,309"
that Julia might be taking these pills,Therapist,neutral,Open question,903,4,3,13,"00:05:38,343","00:05:40,210"
because she and your son have chosen to,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,903,5,3,13,"00:05:40,245","00:05:44,748"
in order not to get pregnant?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,903,6,3,13,"00:05:44,783","00:05:46,917"
Arun has told me more than once,Client,neutral,undefined,903,7,3,13,"00:05:46,952","00:05:48,919"
that he wished to have another son.,Client,neutral,undefined,903,8,3,13,"00:05:48,954","00:05:51,655"
And need I remind you,Client,neutral,undefined,904,0,3,13,"00:05:51,690","00:05:53,657"
that when I moved in their home,Client,neutral,undefined,904,1,3,13,"00:05:53,692","00:05:55,693"
it was clearly stated,Client,neutral,undefined,904,2,3,13,"00:05:55,727","00:05:57,628"
that my room on the third floor was temporary;,Client,neutral,undefined,904,3,3,13,"00:05:57,662","00:06:00,097"
and it would be,Client,neutral,undefined,904,4,3,13,"00:06:00,131","00:06:01,932"
eventually transformed into the new baby's room,Client,neutral,undefined,904,5,3,13,"00:06:01,967","00:06:05,069"
and I would move down to the basement? Do you remember?,Client,neutral,undefined,904,6,3,13,"00:06:05,103","00:06:07,905"
"Yes, I remember you told me that, yeah.",Therapist,neutral,Approval,904,7,3,13,"00:06:07,939","00:06:10,307"
"If this is indeed the case,",Client,anger,undefined,904,8,3,13,"00:06:10,342","00:06:12,142"
then can somebody please explain to me,Client,anger,undefined,904,9,3,13,"00:06:12,177","00:06:14,912"
why Julia is using contraception's?,Client,anger,undefined,904,10,3,13,"00:06:14,946","00:06:19,249"
"If Julia intends to have another child with my son,",Client,anger,undefined,904,11,3,13,"00:06:20,719","00:06:23,020"
she should be trying to do so.,Client,anger,undefined,904,12,3,13,"00:06:23,054","00:06:26,490"
But clearly this is not her wish.,Client,anger,undefined,904,13,3,13,"00:06:26,524","00:06:28,659"
This obviously upsets you...,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,904,14,3,13,"00:06:28,693","00:06:30,761"
This aspect of Julia and Arun's private life.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,904,15,3,13,"00:06:30,795","00:06:35,532"

I have nothing to do with it?,Client,anger,undefined,904,22,3,13,"00:06:51,950","00:06:54,218"

something terribly wrong.,Client,fear,undefined,908,17,3,13,"00:11:17,181","00:11:20,150"

"I could not fall back asleep,",Client,neutral,undefined,908,24,3,13,"00:11:45,910","00:11:49,212"

My son and his wife sleep,Client,neutral,undefined,909,0,3,13,"00:11:52,850","00:11:55,519"

I must learn to smoke so that I can talk to her.,Client,neutral,undefined,911,7,3,13,"00:15:43,781","00:15:46,449"
I suppose there are worse reasons people start to smoke.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,911,8,3,13,"00:15:46,484","00:15:50,554"

And I thought I was being so sophisticated.,Client,neutral,undefined,911,12,3,13,"00:15:59,864","00:16:03,600"
And Malini smoked with such ease.,Client,neutral,undefined,911,13,3,13,"00:16:03,634","00:16:06,937"
And you must know one thing... in those days,Client,neutral,undefined,911,14,3,13,"00:16:06,971","00:16:08,939"
it was extremely rare for a woman to smoke outside.,Client,neutral,undefined,911,15,3,13,"00:16:08,973","00:16:12,108"

to keep the societal order.,Client,neutral,undefined,911,34,3,13,"00:17:02,460","00:17:05,662"

but I imagine that it must have been hard to hear.,Therapist,neutral,Open question,987,12,3,18,"00:05:16,632","00:05:20,268"
It was very hard. I couldn't even take it in.,Client,depression,undefined,987,13,3,18,"00:05:20,302","00:05:23,304"

I wonder if he gets cold in the winter.,Client,depression,undefined,987,29,3,18,"00:06:01,510","00:06:04,946"

He is one of Maxine's houseboys.,Client,joy,undefined,988,8,3,18,"00:06:22,798","00:06:25,500"
After the preview I went out for a quick drink with the cast.,Client,joy,undefined,988,9,3,18,"00:06:25,534","00:06:28,436"
"And I was gonna call Tricia afterwards, when I got home.",Client,joy,undefined,988,10,3,18,"00:06:28,470","00:06:31,205"
I knew she'd be up. She sleeps during the day,Client,joy,undefined,988,11,3,18,"00:06:31,240","00:06:34,175"

and scope the place out and then I'd get some coffee.,Client,disgust,undefined,998,3,3,19,"00:04:44,022","00:04:47,291"

maybe they were the neighbors' kids or...,Client,disgust,undefined,998,13,3,19,"00:05:21,092","00:05:24,161"

if I can open this.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,11,3,20,"00:05:39,209","00:05:42,412"
"Okay, that's it.",Client,depression,undefined,1006,12,3,20,"00:05:42,446","00:05:44,914"
So what do we have left... half a session?,Client,depression,undefined,1006,13,3,20,"00:05:44,948","00:05:47,350"
If that.,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1006,14,3,20,"00:05:47,384","00:05:49,352"
You've had a big day.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,1006,15,3,20,"00:05:49,386","00:05:51,354"
I got in the car and drove back.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,16,3,20,"00:05:51,388","00:05:53,723"
Traffic started immediately.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,17,3,20,"00:05:53,757","00:05:56,025"
I started to sweat. I thought I was having a heart attack.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,18,3,20,"00:05:56,060","00:05:59,395"
"The last time you were here,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1006,19,3,20,"00:06:03,600","00:06:05,234"
you hadn't been able to talk to Max,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1006,20,3,20,"00:06:05,269","00:06:07,236"
"about your health, Steve and...",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1006,21,3,20,"00:06:07,271","00:06:10,306"
I talked to him.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,22,3,20,"00:06:10,341","00:06:12,542"
What made you finally decide to?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1006,23,3,20,"00:06:12,576","00:06:15,144"
You did.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,24,3,20,"00:06:15,179","00:06:17,447"
At least in part.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,25,3,20,"00:06:17,481","00:06:19,749"
"It took me till last night, but I finally,",Client,depression,undefined,1006,26,3,20,"00:06:19,783","00:06:22,251"
"thanks to you,",Client,depression,undefined,1006,27,3,20,"00:06:22,286","00:06:24,220"
forced myself to talk to him.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,28,3,20,"00:06:24,254","00:06:27,090"
And?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1006,29,3,20,"00:06:27,124","00:06:28,224"
It was clear right away that this was,Client,depression,undefined,1006,30,3,20,"00:06:28,258","00:06:30,827"
what he really wanted,Client,depression,undefined,1006,31,3,20,"00:06:30,861","00:06:32,795"
and that he'd only come to stay with me,Client,depression,undefined,1006,32,3,20,"00:06:32,830","00:06:35,064"
because he'd been worried about me,Client,depression,undefined,1006,33,3,20,"00:06:35,099","00:06:37,100"
and that really he ought to be there.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,34,3,20,"00:06:37,134","00:06:41,371"
In Maryland?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1006,35,3,20,"00:06:41,405","00:06:42,672"

"yeah,",Client,depression,undefined,1006,37,3,20,"00:06:46,143","00:06:47,577"
as painful as was to realize that.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,38,3,20,"00:06:47,611","00:06:51,614"
The two of you spoke just last night?,Therapist,neutral,Approval,1006,39,3,20,"00:06:51,648","00:06:54,484"
The whole thing just happened so fast.,Client,depression,undefined,1006,40,3,20,"00:06:54,518","00:06:57,186"
"You know, I guess I felt",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,0,3,20,"00:06:57,221","00:06:59,055"
that he'd been up here a month,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,1,3,20,"00:06:59,089","00:07:01,391"
and I just wanted to get him home for his sake,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,2,3,20,"00:07:01,425","00:07:05,395"
and also to...,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,3,3,20,"00:07:05,429","00:07:07,029"
What?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1007,4,3,20,"00:07:07,064","00:07:08,164"
Get it over with.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,5,3,20,"00:07:08,198","00:07:10,933"
He asked me inside,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,6,3,20,"00:07:12,936","00:07:15,605"
for coffee.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,7,3,20,"00:07:15,639","00:07:17,907"
You mean...,Therapist,neutral,Approval,1007,8,3,20,"00:07:17,941","00:07:19,375"
Steve.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,9,3,20,"00:07:19,410","00:07:21,377"
Kate wasn't there.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,10,3,20,"00:07:21,412","00:07:25,381"
"You know, he seemed...",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,11,3,20,"00:07:25,416","00:07:27,617"
"he seemed, you know, okay...",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,12,3,20,"00:07:27,651","00:07:30,520"
"all-American, you know,",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,13,3,20,"00:07:30,554","00:07:33,456"

"He looked, you know, like dad.",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,15,3,20,"00:07:35,926","00:07:40,229"
Unlike you?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1007,16,3,20,"00:07:40,264","00:07:42,598"
Did you go in?,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,17,3,20,"00:07:42,633","00:07:44,867"
I...,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,18,3,20,"00:07:47,371","00:07:49,939"
I couldn't.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,19,3,20,"00:07:49,973","00:07:51,174"
I just had to get out of there.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,20,3,20,"00:07:51,208","00:07:54,777"
"It made it easier in some ways, you know...",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,21,3,20,"00:07:56,413","00:07:58,548"
"his glaring decency,",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,22,3,20,"00:07:58,582","00:08:01,417"
his ease with Max.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,23,3,20,"00:08:01,452","00:08:04,153"
And yet in other ways,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1007,24,3,20,"00:08:04,188","00:08:05,888"
I can imagine that was very difficult to see.,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1007,25,3,20,"00:08:05,923","00:08:08,758"
I think maybe it was the hardest thing,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,26,3,20,"00:08:08,792","00:08:11,561"
"I've ever had to do, you know...",Client,disgust,undefined,1007,27,3,20,"00:08:11,595","00:08:14,931"
walk away from that house,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,28,3,20,"00:08:14,965","00:08:17,166"
leaving Max behind,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,29,3,20,"00:08:17,201","00:08:20,837"
with him.,Client,disgust,undefined,1007,30,3,20,"00:08:20,871","00:08:22,472"
But after our session last week,Client,depression,undefined,1008,0,3,20,"00:08:22,506","00:08:25,641"
I saw that...,Client,depression,undefined,1008,1,3,20,"00:08:25,676","00:08:27,610"
"I saw that you were right,",Client,depression,undefined,1008,2,3,20,"00:08:27,644","00:08:30,012"
"that I didn't have a choice,",Client,depression,undefined,1008,3,3,20,"00:08:30,047","00:08:32,982"
that I had to face the truth.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,4,3,20,"00:08:33,016","00:08:35,651"
"Will you tell me about your talk,",Therapist,neutral,Open question,1008,5,3,20,"00:08:35,686","00:08:37,687"
how you got yourself to face the truth?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1008,6,3,20,"00:08:37,721","00:08:41,057"
We were making pancakes late.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,7,3,20,"00:08:41,091","00:08:43,926"
"And I was just beginning to get into it, you know,",Client,depression,undefined,1008,8,3,20,"00:08:43,961","00:08:47,096"
trying to find the right words.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,9,3,20,"00:08:47,130","00:08:49,465"
And the doorbell rings. And it's Jesse.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,10,3,20,"00:08:49,500","00:08:52,935"
What time was this?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1008,11,3,20,"00:08:52,970","00:08:55,004"
I don't know. About 10:30 maybe.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,12,3,20,"00:08:55,038","00:08:57,440"
And you let him in?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1008,13,3,20,"00:08:57,474","00:08:59,175"
I had to.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,14,3,20,"00:08:59,209","00:09:01,177"
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,1008,15,3,20,"00:08:59,209","00:09:01,177"
He'd been to visit his birth parents,Client,depression,undefined,1008,16,3,20,"00:09:01,211","00:09:03,846"
and they fucking rejected him.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,17,3,20,"00:09:03,881","00:09:06,582"
The kid was devastated.,Client,depression,undefined,1008,18,3,20,"00:09:06,617","00:09:09,685"
Did it feel easier for you to deal,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1008,19,3,20,"00:09:09,720","00:09:11,687"
with Jesse's problems in your office,Therapist,neutral,Approval,1008,20,3,20,"00:09:11,722","00:09:13,689"
than the ones with Max at home?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1008,21,3,20,"00:09:13,724","00:09:15,725"
"If you'd seen what Jesse looked like, you would have let him in too.",Client,depression,undefined,1008,22,3,20,"00:09:15,759","00:09:18,794"
"So I said to Max, okay look, we'll talk about this later.",Client,neutral,undefined,1009,0,3,20,"00:09:18,829","00:09:22,198"
This is an emergency. I have to deal with it.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,1,3,20,"00:09:22,232","00:09:24,200"
We'll make the pancakes for breakfast.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,2,3,20,"00:09:24,234","00:09:26,836"
Then I went in. I spoke to Jesse.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,3,3,20,"00:09:26,870","00:09:30,473"
15 minutes later the smoke alarm goes off.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,4,3,20,"00:09:30,507","00:09:33,342"
I'm sorry?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1009,5,3,20,"00:09:33,377","00:09:34,844"
He'd tried to make the pancakes himself,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,6,3,20,"00:09:34,878","00:09:36,679"
and the pan went on fire.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,7,3,20,"00:09:36,713","00:09:38,681"
So I put the flames out and I realized,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,8,3,20,"00:09:38,715","00:09:41,784"
that I had to talk to my son.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,9,3,20,"00:09:41,818","00:09:45,922"
I... I... I... I couldn't wait any longer.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,10,3,20,"00:09:45,956","00:09:50,226"
You just told me you were determined to do it anyway.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1009,11,3,20,"00:09:50,260","00:09:53,496"
The point is that I did it.,Client,neutral,undefined,1009,12,3,20,"00:09:53,530","00:09:56,599"
"Once Max set the stove on fire,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1009,13,3,20,"00:09:56,633","00:09:58,568"
once you left Jesse.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1009,14,3,20,"00:09:58,602","00:10:00,136"
"Oh, for fuck's sake.",Client,neutral,undefined,1009,15,3,20,"00:10:00,170","00:10:01,904"
I'm telling you about this traumatic event,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,0,3,20,"00:10:01,939","00:10:03,606"
where I finally faced up to something,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,1,3,20,"00:10:03,640","00:10:05,608"
"that is extremely painful with my son,",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,2,3,20,"00:10:05,642","00:10:09,812"
"maybe the lowest moment of my life,",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,3,3,20,"00:10:09,846","00:10:12,048"
"which you have encouraged me to tackle,",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,4,3,20,"00:10:12,082","00:10:13,849"
"which took all the strength that I had,",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,5,3,20,"00:10:13,884","00:10:16,886"
and all you can do is focus,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,6,3,20,"00:10:16,920","00:10:18,888"
on a mistake that you think I made...,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,7,3,20,"00:10:18,922","00:10:20,890"
"that I, God forbid, tried to help a troubled patient?",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,8,3,20,"00:10:20,924","00:10:24,160"
I do see how wrenching this was for you.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1010,9,3,20,"00:10:24,194","00:10:27,196"
I do.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,10,3,20,"00:10:27,230","00:10:29,565"
"And at the same time, since you've walked in,",Therapist,neutral,Open question,1010,11,3,20,"00:10:29,600","00:10:31,734"
I've been fully aware of your clear need,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1010,12,3,20,"00:10:31,768","00:10:34,670"
for me to grasp and acknowledge your pain.,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1010,13,3,20,"00:10:34,705","00:10:37,907"
"Well, you are my therapist.",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,14,3,20,"00:10:37,941","00:10:40,443"
Yes.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,15,3,20,"00:10:40,477","00:10:42,478"
And I do happen to be in pain.,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,16,3,20,"00:10:42,512","00:10:47,283"
I know that. I see that.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,1010,17,3,20,"00:10:47,317","00:10:49,585"
You even brought in a prop,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,18,3,20,"00:10:49,620","00:10:51,387"
to demonstrate in case I missed it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,19,3,20,"00:10:51,421","00:10:53,322"
"Well, I do also have a fucking headache.",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,20,3,20,"00:10:53,357","00:10:56,292"
I believe you.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,21,3,20,"00:10:56,326","00:10:57,927"
"But the more clearly I see the pain you're in,",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,22,3,20,"00:10:57,961","00:11:00,429"
the greater the chance I'll see what you've done,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,23,3,20,"00:11:00,464","00:11:03,065"
as courageous and heroic,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,24,3,20,"00:11:03,100","00:11:05,334"
and less of a chance that I'd question,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,25,3,20,"00:11:05,369","00:11:07,370"
or criticize any part of it.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,26,3,20,"00:11:07,404","00:11:09,105"
"Well, go ahead",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,27,3,20,"00:11:09,139","00:11:11,340"
"and criticize,",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,28,3,20,"00:11:11,375","00:11:13,876"
if that's what you feel the need to do.,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,29,3,20,"00:11:13,910","00:11:17,747"
I do find I have some questions,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1010,30,3,20,"00:11:17,781","00:11:20,182"
regarding your decision about Max.,Therapist,neutral,Approval,1010,31,3,20,"00:11:20,217","00:11:22,451"
What made it so urgent for you to finally bring him...?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1010,32,3,20,"00:11:22,486","00:11:25,321"
Can I say something?,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,33,3,20,"00:11:25,355","00:11:27,757"
All right.,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1010,34,3,20,"00:11:27,791","00:11:29,892"
You say that I seem to be looking,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,35,3,20,"00:11:29,926","00:11:31,894"
"for a certain response from you,",Client,disgust,undefined,1010,36,3,20,"00:11:31,928","00:11:34,497"
that I'm invested in your reaction.,Client,disgust,undefined,1010,37,3,20,"00:11:34,531","00:11:37,366"
But you're avoiding,Client,depression,undefined,1011,0,3,20,"00:11:37,401","00:11:41,170"
any acknowledgment,Client,depression,undefined,1011,1,3,20,"00:11:41,204","00:11:43,539"
of why that might be.,Client,depression,undefined,1011,2,3,20,"00:11:43,573","00:11:45,474"
I'm not sure I'm following.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1011,3,3,20,"00:11:45,509","00:11:48,210"
I think you're dancing around the obvious reason,Client,depression,undefined,1011,4,3,20,"00:11:48,245","00:11:50,513"

I remember our session quite well.,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1011,21,3,20,"00:12:37,761","00:12:40,096"
"So why the delicate evasion,",Client,depression,undefined,1011,22,3,20,"00:12:40,163","00:12:41,964"
the muted suggestion?,Client,depression,undefined,1011,23,3,20,"00:12:41,998","00:12:44,533"

of your feelings for me?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1011,25,3,20,"00:12:49,606","00:12:52,875"

that I haven't brought up what we discussed last week?,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1011,27,3,20,"00:12:57,681","00:13:01,117"
I was just surprised,Client,depression,undefined,1011,28,3,20,"00:13:01,151","00:13:03,052"
that you hadn't mentioned it.,Client,depression,undefined,1011,29,3,20,"00:13:03,086","00:13:06,355"

that this hasn't been foremost on my mind.,Client,depression,undefined,1011,31,3,20,"00:13:09,092","00:13:12,128"
Okay.,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1011,32,3,20,"00:13:12,162","00:13:13,329"

I've been concentrated on my son.,Client,depression,undefined,1011,34,3,20,"00:13:15,432","00:13:17,700"

you weren't even on my radar.,Client,depression,undefined,1012,1,3,20,"00:13:19,936","00:13:24,240"

I thought those thoughts had disappeared.,Client,depression,undefined,1012,3,3,20,"00:13:26,943","00:13:30,112"
But they hadn't?,Therapist,neutral,Restatement,1012,4,3,20,"00:13:30,147","00:13:32,414"

What?,Therapist,neutral,Open question,1012,12,3,20,"00:13:58,441","00:14:00,276"
And I just realized,Client,depression,undefined,1012,13,3,20,"00:14:00,310","00:14:03,212"
that the only person I wanted to see,Client,depression,undefined,1012,14,3,20,"00:14:03,246","00:14:07,149"
when I got back to New York,Client,depression,undefined,1012,15,3,20,"00:14:07,184","00:14:09,018"

I just... I couldn't imagine it.,Client,depression,undefined,1012,21,3,20,"00:14:26,236","00:14:30,973"
But I knew that you would understand.,Client,depression,undefined,1012,22,3,20,"00:14:31,007","00:14:34,210"
Last week you spoke about these feelings,Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1012,23,3,20,"00:14:34,244","00:14:37,313"
"as ridiculous, a kind of comeuppance.",Therapist,neutral,Interpretation,1012,24,3,20,"00:14:37,347","00:14:39,882"
It's true that I've seen this kind of thing before.,Client,depression,undefined,1012,25,3,20,"00:14:39,916","00:14:44,353"
I'm familiar with the dynamic of transference.,Client,depression,undefined,1013,0,3,20,"00:14:44,387","00:14:47,523"
And... and yet,Client,depression,undefined,1013,1,3,20,"00:14:47,557","00:14:50,092"
I can't help but think,Client,depression,undefined,1013,2,3,20,"00:14:50,126","00:14:53,095"
that maybe this is,Client,depression,undefined,1013,3,3,20,"00:14:53,129","00:14:57,867"
something more.,Client,depression,undefined,1013,4,3,20,"00:14:57,901","00:15:00,002"
